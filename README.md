# What a surprise to see you here! Who are you?

I am formally a frontend and backend developer, having worked in the industry for over a decade. My strengths are:
- data modeling and query optimization
- infrastructure as code and ci/cd for frontend
- SDLC processes and codebase maturity

# Skills

## What's your favorite technology right now?
Honestly? I'm a fan of everything javascript. [^1]. 

## Anything else?
I try and choose the most applicable tool that is appropriate for the task. I'm fond of Software Engineering as a craft -- there are a lot of technologies to choose from.

In no particular order, these are some of the technologies I'm familiar with:
- Frontend: React, HTML/a11y, Typescript
- Backend: Nodejs, Java/Spring
- Databases: NoSQL (DynamoDB), Postgres, PL/SQL

## Any advice to your readers?
- Being well organized with codebases improves understanding of every feature's scope.
- Documentation, tests and clear instructions contribute the most to a project's health.
- Learn Markdown, it will help you organize your thoughts.
