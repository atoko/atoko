# What a surprise to see you here! (shocked) Who are you?

I'm software engineer from a musician family. I started playing with all sorts of knobs and keyboards at an early age, tinkering with tape machines, and retro computers.  I initially dreamt of composing video game scores or even creating the games themselves. Growing up, my journey was always to create experiences that would inspire.

## Why ?
 Learning a new technology is exciting to me -- I do not see it as a challenge but as a new opportunity for self expression. Much like learning a new instrument. 

I admire artists and engineers and receive inspiration from their inventions. Words to live by: _there isn't such a thing as version 1.0_. Programming is an iterative process (every day brings a new challenge).

> Artists and engineers?
Yes, I consider myself a bit of both. I started my online persona by drawing custom forum signatures, but I didn't get too far there. After some time, my learning was more oriented towards game development. Crafting is my passion, please don't call it perfectionism. 

When I was young, I started my career by creating mobile applications. This was time-consuming, as I strived to make a good experience, while still having responsibilities at home and at university. I worked with Tokyopop and met with designers on a weekly basis. Exhausting! 

Ultimately, we pulled through and delivered everything. A lesson to remember: the process of creativity takes time!

# Let's get philosophical 

## What's your favorite technology?
Honestly? The rice cooker. Neat little thing. Oh, programming language? Well, I do regularly contribute to typescript codebases [^1]. Regardless, I don't have any favorites. I try and choose the most applicable tools that is appropriate for the task. I'm fond of Software Engineering as a craft -- there are a lot of technologies, too many, in fact [^2]. However, I have a special place in my heart for frontend engineers. Design Systems rock!

In no particular order, here are some technologies I'm familiar with:
- Pl/SQL
- UML
- HTML (a11y compatible)
- Multimedia Fusion
- Postgres
- Java / Spring
- Arduino

## Any advice to your readers?
Being well organized with codebases improves understanding of every feature's scope. Documentation, tests and clear instructions contribute the most to a project's health.
Learn Markdown, it will help you organize your thoughts.

# How do you utilize your power to uplift those around you?

I believe in the power of collaboration; To me it is not about being right, but about working towards a common goal. Volunteering my time to Girls Who Code, I spent more time thinking about developer experience than about database schemas.

I channel my energy in my free time to create art. Since young, I was always taught to keep myself busy. To me, this meant creating. Some of my favorites (both legacy and new):

- Photoshop
- Snapseed
- Notepad++
- Blender
- Renoise

I consider myself a bit of a chiptune freak, if you will.

# How do you balance the pursuit of professional and personal fulfillment?

One small piece of advice: never take code personally. Code that doesn't work can still be learned from, and tomorrow is a fresh start. Repeat after me: 
**"Not all of my pull requests will be accepted. Not everyone will have the same opinion"**. As long as you are coherent, you can always find a way to compromise.

Always do your best, knowing that if your team is on the same wavelength, you will find success.
