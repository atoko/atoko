# What a surprise to see you here! Who are you?

I'm @atoko, a software engineer from a musician family. I started playing with keyboards and retro computers at an early age, tinkering and creating games in C++.  I initially dreamt of composing video game scores or even creating the games themselves. Growing up, my journey was always to create experiences that would inspire.

## Why ?
 Learning a new technology is exciting to me -- I do not see it as a challenge but as a new opportunity for self expression. Much like learning a new instrument. 

I admire artists and engineers and receive inspiration from their inventions. Words to live by: _there isn't such a thing as version 1.0_. Programming is an iterative process (every day brings a new challenge).

> How did you get started?
When I was young, I started my career by creating mobile applications. This was time-consuming, as I strived to make a good experience, while still having responsibilities at home and at university. I worked with Tokyopop and met with designers on a weekly basis. Exhausting! 

Ultimately, we pulled through and delivered everything. A lesson to remember: the process of creativity takes time!

# And now?

I am formally a frontend and backend developer, having worked in the industry for over a decade. My strengths are:
- data modeling and querying
- infrastructure as code and ci/cd for frontend
- SDLC processes and codebase maturity

# Skills

## What's your favorite technology right now?
Honestly? I'm a fan of everything javascript. [^1]. 

## Anything else?
I try and choose the most applicable tool that is appropriate for the task. I'm fond of Software Engineering as a craft -- there are a lot of technologies, too many, in fact [^2]. However, Design Systems rock!

In no particular order, these are some of the technologies I'm familiar with:
- Frontend: React, HTML/a11y, Typescript
- Backend: Nodejs, Java/Spring
- Databases: NoSQL (DynamoDB), Postgres, PL/SQL

## Any advice to your readers?
- Being well organized with codebases improves understanding of every feature's scope.
- Documentation, tests and clear instructions contribute the most to a project's health.
- Learn Markdown, it will help you organize your thoughts.

# How do you utilize your power to uplift those around you?

I believe in the power of collaboration; To me it is not about being right, but about working towards a common goal. Volunteering my time to Girls Who Code, I spent more time thinking about developer experience than about database schemas.

# What else do you do?

I channel my energy in my free time to create art. Since young, I was always taught to keep myself busy. To me, this meant creating. Some of my favorites:

- Pixelmator
- Renoise
- Serum 2
